# Trash Can Bot
## RFID Presence Detection with SMS
The Trash Can Bot is powered by a Particle Photon and uses a MFRC522 module for the RFID reader.

I am currently using this to detect my trash can in my garage. The bot is connected to WiFi and will alert me, via SMS and Slack, if my trash can is detected after 9pm the night before trash pickup.
